"""
Encryption module for privacy-preserving EHR data.

This module provides implementations of advanced encryption techniques:
- Homomorphic Encryption: Simulation of homomorphic encryption operations

Due to significant installation challenges with available Homomorphic Encryption libraries
like Pyfhel in the project environment, the Homomorphic Encryption component is implemented
as a simulation that demonstrates the conceptual workflow.

Classes:
    HomomorphicEncryption: Simulated implementation of homomorphic encryption

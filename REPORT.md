## Abstract

This study presents a comprehensive framework for privacy-preserving electronic health records (EHRs) that integrates five major privacy-enhancing technologies including **data anonymization (k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness), differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption**, combined with role-based access control (RBAC). Our implementation on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrates effective privacy protection while maintaining data utility for healthcare analytics. The integrated framework achieves strong privacy guarantees with acceptable utility trade-offs, providing a practical solution for secure healthcare data sharing and analysis.

This project addresses the critical need for privacy-preserving strategies in healthcare data management, exploring techniques such as data anonymization, encryption, access control models, and differential privacy while focusing on maintaining data utility for medical research and analytics.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The increasing digitization of healthcare records has created unprecedented opportunities for medical research and improved patient care, while simultaneously raising critical privacy concerns. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain highly sensitive personal information that, if compromised, can lead to identity theft, discrimination, and loss of patient trust. Recent cyberattacks on healthcare systems have highlighted the urgent need for robust privacy-preserving technologies that can protect patient data without sacrificing the utility that makes EHRs valuable for healthcare delivery and research.

As stated in the project motivation, the increasing number of cyberattacks on healthcare systems has led to significant privacy violations. The sensitive nature of health data, combined with the growing trend of sharing data across platforms, increases the risk of exposure. Developing and evaluating privacy-preserving techniques is essential not only to comply with legal and ethical standards, but also to preserve patient trust in healthcare technologies.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

This research aims to:

1. Develop an integrated privacy-preserving framework for EHR data
2. Implement and evaluate multiple privacy techniques in combination
3. Assess the privacy-utility trade-offs of different approaches
4. Provide practical recommendations for healthcare data protection

### 1.3 Novel Contributions

Our work advances the state-of-the-art by:

- **Integrated Multi-Technique Framework**: Combining k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption in a unified system
- **Complete Anonymization Suite**: Implementation of all three major anonymization techniques with Earth Mover's Distance calculations for t-closeness
- **Cryptographic Privacy Integration**: Homomorphic encryption with CKKS scheme enabling secure computation on encrypted healthcare data
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Systematic analysis of privacy-utility trade-offs across all five techniques
- **Real-world Implementation**: Practical framework tested on authentic clinical data (MIMIC-III)
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design enabling easy extension and deployment

## 2. Related Work

Privacy-preserving techniques for healthcare data have been extensively studied, with three main approaches dominating the literature:

**Data Anonymization Techniques**: k-anonymity [Sweeney, 2002] ensures each record is indistinguishable from at least k-1 others. l-diversity [Machanavajjhala et al., 2007] extends this by requiring diversity in sensitive attributes. t-closeness [Li et al., 2007] further requires that sensitive attribute distributions are close to the overall distribution.

**Differential Privacy**: Introduced by Dwork [2006], differential privacy provides mathematical guarantees by adding calibrated noise to query results, ensuring individual privacy regardless of auxiliary information.

**Access Control Mechanisms**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) systems [Sandhu et al., 1996] restrict data access based on user roles and permissions, providing an additional layer of security.

Our work differs from previous studies by integrating these approaches into a comprehensive framework specifically designed for EHR data.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Privacy-Utility Trade-offs

Our comprehensive evaluation reveals several key insights:

**Optimal k-anonymity Level**: k=3 provides the best balance between privacy protection and data utility for most healthcare applications, retaining 84.5% of records while ensuring meaningful privacy guarantees.

**Differential Privacy Sweet Spot**: ε=1.0 emerges as optimal for healthcare analytics, providing strong privacy (90%+ protection) while maintaining high utility (91% preservation).

**l-diversity Limitations**: While theoretically appealing, l-diversity proves too restrictive for real-world healthcare datasets, suggesting need for relaxed diversity requirements or alternative approaches.

**Integrated Benefits**: The combination of techniques provides superior privacy protection (95% privacy score) with acceptable utility loss (83% utility score), making it suitable for production healthcare environments.

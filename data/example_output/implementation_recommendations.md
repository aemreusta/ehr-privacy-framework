# Privacy-Preserving EHR Implementation Recommendations

## Executive Summary
Analysis of 129 patient records demonstrates effective privacy-preserving techniques while maintaining clinical utility.

## Key Findings
- **Optimal k-anonymity level**: k=2 provides best privacy-utility balance
- **Data retention**: 115 records (89.1% retention rate)
- **Processing efficiency**: Average 0.01s per anonymization

## Implementation Recommendations
1. **Deploy k-anonymity with k=3-5** for routine analytics
2. **Implement role-based access control** for multi-tier security
3. **Use differential privacy** for aggregate queries
4. **Regular privacy auditing** to maintain compliance

## Technical Specifications
- Quasi-identifiers: age, gender, admission_type, ethnicity
- Sensitive attributes: diagnosis, mortality
- Suppression threshold: 20%
- Minimum group size verification: âœ“
